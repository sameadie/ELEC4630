# ELEC4630
Four assignments written for Image Processing and Computer Vision (ELEC4630) in Semester 1, 2019 at the University of Queensland.

## Assignment 1
### License Plate Segmentation
The segmentation of license plates was developed as a preprocessing step for numberplate recognition. This process primarily involved thresholding and morphological operations. 

### Pantograph Line Tracking
The power supply line in contact with a train's pantograph was tracked from a train-mounted video recording. The line's intersection with the pantograph's carbon brush was found. The system distinguishes between multiple overhead lines and line switches.  

## Assignment 2
### The Hough Transform 
The Hough Transform was implemented for line detection, compared with its MATLAB counterpart and demonstrated on a Taj Mahal example. 

### MRI Heart Segmentation
Magnetic Resonance Images of the heart were contoured through a cost minimisation in a Viterbi Trellis Search Space. This was used to estimate the ventricle's volume as it pumped 

## Assignment 3
### HEP2 Segmentation
ANA IFF HEP2 cell images were segmented using thresholds from a BW k-means clustering algorithm.

### Line Tracing
Line tracing was performed on greyscale images for string length determination and to solve a basic children's game. 

## Assignment 4
### Face Recognition 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for facial recognition (eigenfaces) and a simple GUI was developed for use. 

### Volumetric Modelling 
A 3D model of a toy dinosaur was generated from 36 images at 10 degree increments using a shape from silhouette method.
